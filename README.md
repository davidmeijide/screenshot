# Automatic screenshot generator

This project uses [https://www.screenshotmachine.com API](https://www.screenshotmachine.com/website-screenshot-api.php) for taking screenshots from a URL.

Then, the image is uploaded [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10ze2oFvaMFhnPGM7e53Q8vWumel04nxi?usp=sharing).

The user can request uploads from the frontend **after Google Authentication**.

The stack used was PHP for the backend and Javascript for the frontend.
